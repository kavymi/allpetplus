- ✅ Understanding why a feature was built a certain way
- ✅ Reviewing what was included in a past implementation
- ✅ Understanding the evolution of the codebase
- ✅ Troubleshooting based on historical issues

### When NOT to Reference
- ❌ As current setup instructions (use `/docs/guides/`)
- ❌ As current code patterns (use `/docs/development/`)
- ❌ For current architecture (use `/docs/architecture/`)

## Migration Notes

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Reason:** Codebase organization and documentation cleanup  
**Moved From:** Root directory (`/*.md` files)

These files were cluttering the root directory. Current documentation is now properly organized in `/docs/`.

**For current documentation, see `/docs/README.md`**
