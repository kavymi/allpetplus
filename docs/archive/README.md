## 🗂️ September 2025

**Phase:** Initial setup, tRPC implementation, architecture decisions

### Major Milestones
- tRPC migration complete
- Hybrid architecture implemented
- Modular monolith established
- Pet profiles service created

### Documents

## 🗂️ Legacy

**Phase:** Pre-September 2025

### Documents
- Historical implementation notes
- Early architecture decisions
- Setup and migration docs

---

## 📝 Document Naming Convention

Archive documents follow this pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
```

Example: `2025-10-23-codebase-audit-complete.md`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Archive?
Documents are archived when:
1. Work is complete and documented elsewhere
2. Historical record needed for reference
3. Implementation details superseded by newer approach
4. Context useful for understanding evolution

### Active Documentation
For current documentation, see:
- `/docs/guides/` - How-to guides
- `/docs/architecture/` - Current architecture
- `/docs/development/` - Development practices

### Don't Delete
Archive documents should NOT be deleted because:
- Provide historical context
- Explain why decisions were made
- Show evolution of codebase
- Useful for retrospectives
